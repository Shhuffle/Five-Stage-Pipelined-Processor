# Five-Stage-Pipelined-Processor
A **five-stage pipelined RISC processor** implemented in **Verilog**, featuring arithmetic, logic, memory, and branching operations. Includes a testbench for simulation. Future improvements: hazard detection, forwarding, and instruction set expansion.



This project implements a five-stage pipelined RISC processor using Verilog with basic arithmetic, logic, memory, and branch operations.

Features
Five-stage pipeline: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB

Basic RISC instruction set (ADD, SUB, OR, AND, MUL, LW, SW, Branch, Compare, etc.)

Register-based computation & memory access

Simple branching mechanism with halt support




Simulation
Running the Testbench

Compile five_stage_processor.v and tb_processor.v using a Verilog simulator.

Run the simulation to observe outputs.
